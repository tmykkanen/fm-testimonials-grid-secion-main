## My process

### Built with

- ![Astro](https://img.shields.io/badge/astro-%232C2052.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=astro&logoColor=white)
- ![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-%2338B2AC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)
- ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)

### What I learned

- I implemented google font using `@import url`
- I focused on trying to use as much vanilla css as possible. I still used tailwind for general reset and a few utility classes.
- I tried `<header>` as a semantic html tag (rather than just the wrapper for a header nav).
- I continued to improve my understanding of CSS Grid and @container queries.

### Continued development

- I'd like to continue to use flex / grid better.
- I'd like to make my CSS as clean as possible.

### Useful resources

- In my googling, I came across these helpful articles. Didn't use them much in this particular project, but I'm saving here for future reference.
